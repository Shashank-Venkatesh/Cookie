🍪 Cookies in Web Development

📌 What is a Cookie?

A cookie is a small piece of data stored in the user's browser by a website. It helps websites remember user preferences, login sessions, and other browsing activities. Cookies are mainly used for authentication, tracking user sessions, and storing user-specific information.

🔍 How Do Cookies Work?

When a user visits a website, the server sends a cookie along with the HTTP response.

The browser stores the cookie and sends it back to the server with every subsequent request.

The server reads the cookie to retrieve user information and provide a personalized experience.

🔹 Types of Cookies:

Session-based cookies 🕒 (deleted when the browser is closed)

Persistent cookies 📁 (stored for a specific time)

HTTP-only cookies 🔒 (not accessible via JavaScript for security purposes)

⚙️ Setting Up a Basic Cookie Project

📦 Packages to Install

To create a basic Node.js project handling cookies, install the following packages:

npm init -y  # Initialize Node.js project
npm install express cookie-parser
npm install --save-dev nodemon  # Optional for development


🏁 Conclusion

Cookies play a crucial role in web applications, providing session management, user tracking, and data persistence. By using Express.js and cookie-parser, we can easily handle cookies in our backend projects.
